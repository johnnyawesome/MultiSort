# MultiSort
Visual version of BubbleSort, SelectionSort and InsertionSort sorting algorithms written in P5JS.

![MultiSort](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnnyawesome/MultiSort/master/MultiSort/DemoImages/MultiSort.gif)

MultiSort is a collection of three [sorting algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm). Sorting Algorithms let you sort all kinds of things, like the randmomly generated bars in the image above.

The supported sorting algorithms are:

- BubbleSort
- SelectionSort
- Insertion Sort

Also, I have a separate projects of all of these sorting algorithms, in case you need just one:

- [BubbleSort project](https://github.com/johnnyawesome/BubbleSort)
- [SelectionSort project](https://github.com/johnnyawesome/SelectionSort)
- [InsertionSort project](https://github.com/johnnyawesome/InsertionSort)

## More information

I blogged about this project and how it's code works: Read up on [BubbleSort](https://breaksome.tech/sorting-algorithm-coding-bubblesort-in-p5js/) or check out [this post](https://breaksome.tech/sorting-algorithm:-selectionsort-and-insertionsort/) about [SelectionSort](https://breaksome.tech/sorting-algorithm:-selectionsort-and-insertionsort/) and [InsertionSort](https://breaksome.tech/sorting-algorithm:-selectionsort-and-insertionsort/).
It's a nice step-by-step tutorial that walks you through the projects and explains the whole code one bit at the time.
